# cbiohub

**WARNING ⚠️: This package is still under construction.**


`cbiohub` is a Python package that provides convenience functions for analyzing
data files from [cBioPortal](https://cbioportal.org). Although several Python
API clients exist, they work on slices of the cBioPortal data retrieved via the
REST rather than that they enable easy analysis of all the data files in bulk.
This package aims to provide a more user-friendly interface for accessing data
from cBioPortal like those stored in the public
[datahub](https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub).

## Usage

```python
import cbiohub

# Example usage
# cbiohub.some_function()
# TODO: still under construction
```

## Development

To set up the development environment, install the development dependencies:

```sh
poetry install
```

You can also use IPython for an enhanced interactive experience:

```sh
poetry run ipython
```
